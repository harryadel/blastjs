# Blast

The aim of this project is to extract Blaze and all of its associated packages to NPM so it can be used outside of Meteor.

Clone this repository and run the example applications to test things out.

It's based on previous [work](https://bitbucket.org/znewsham/meteor-blaze/src/master/) project by [Zack Newsham](https://github.com/znewsham).
