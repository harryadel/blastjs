# Webpack Project

This is an example of using blaze to render dynamic HTML with webpack.

This will likely only work in modernish browsers, as no polyfilling is done for you.

run `npm install` to install the dependencies then
run `npm run build` to build the bundle.

Open up `index.html` and see your rendered content.
